          The fragile state of DRC has substantial iron ore deposits in a remote, undeveloped part of the country. The country’s government - keen to diversify economy away from agriculture and forestry – has sold mining concessions with aim of attracting a multinational corporation with the technical expertise and financial capacity to develop the mine. MINECOM, one of the world’s largest mining companies, has created a local subsidiary called IRONCOM to exploit two concessions in DRC. This report provides an overview of the social, environmental, and financial risks associated with IRONCOM’s mining activities .

          To commence the energy intensive process of extracting and transporting iron ore to the sea, MINECOM is planning to build substantial processing infrastructure and accommodation for up to 50,000 miners. To power the mine, MINECOM planned to build two hydroelectric dams. One of the dams will be inside a neighboring protected area and will flood 4 villages upstream of the dam
