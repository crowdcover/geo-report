          The fragile state of DRC has substantial iron ore deposits in a remote, undeveloped part of the country. The country’s government - keen to diversify economy away from agriculture and forestry – has sold mining concessions with aim of attracting a multinational corporation with the technical expertise and financial capacity to develop the mine. MINECOM, one of the world’s largest mining companies, has created a local subsidiary called IRONCOM to exploit two concessions in DRC. This report provides an overview of the social, environmental, and financial risks associated with IRONCOM’s mining activities .

          Existing and planned mining extends across vast swathes of DRC, including much of the forest. There are 590 mining companies with a total of 6,727 permits of which 3,006 are owned by either individual or industrial mining companies and over 152 are identified as artisanal. Mining permits cover over 39% of the DRC’s total land area with exploitation permits covering 2%, exploration permits covering 15% and research permits 22%. Intact forest represents over 400 thousand square kilometers, including 24% of total intact forest areas directly overlapping with mining permits.

          Artisanal mining (ASM) is also widespread throughout the country and while legally bound to certain laws in the Mining Code of 2002, it is largely unregulated. ASM activities overlap many intact forest areas, nation parks and reserves all over the country and due to ongoing-armed conflict and poorly resourced park management, operators act with near impunity.

          It is within this context that Banro, a Canadian mining company, have been developing a series of mining concessions in South Kivu, in the troubled eastern region of DRC. Banro has 13 Exploitation Permits, Banro was awarded 14 exploration permits in March 2007 covering 2,638 square kilometres and located between its Twangiza and Lugushwa projects. Applications for additional exploration permits contiguous to and located between the Company's Lugushwa and Namoya projects, along with areas south of Twangiza, are also pending (http://www.banro.com/s/Properties.asp)

          In addition to industrial mining, the area has a number of artisanal and small scale mines operating in the area. While the mines provide employment for many local community members, mining revenues have been linked to armed militias operating in the area. The map above illustrates rebel groups who have operated gold and  cassiterite mines, some overlapping with the Twangiza concession area.

          Further development of Twangiza concessions will require substantial infrastructure investments. To help power their gold mining operations, Banro plans to part finance a 30MW hydroelectric dam on the Ulindi River (http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2009/02/study-bolsters-plan-for-30-mw-ulindi-2-at-dr-congo-gold-mine.html) one study estimates that 1,860 households comprising 11,532 individuals, mostly farmers or artisanal miners, residing between the Twangiza and Lulimbohwe rivers would be affected by the project. More than 1,200 households would require resettlement. (http://www.miningmarkets.ca/news/john-kaiser-s-ounces-in-the-ground-part-ii--banro-s-twangiza/1000340713/?&er=NA) While there is no data on the precise location of this mine, there are at least two other hydropower projects also planned in the area as well one existing project which may require rehabilitation.

          The influx of workers to the Twangiza mine could further exacerbate conflicts over land and resources with local communities, particularly with pygmy communities.  Barhwa and Babuluko pygmy communities were expelled from Kuhuzi Biega when it was created forcing many to make marginal liveliehoods on the outskirts of the park.
